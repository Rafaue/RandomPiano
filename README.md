# Piano Random

## Project Description
Piano Random is an interactive website with a virtual piano keyboard that allows playing random sounds.
## Features
- Virtual piano keyboard with white and black keys
- Ability to play random piano sounds
- Locking/unlocking individual keys (to exclude them from random selection)
- Hiding/showing information about the currently played sound
- Responsive design adapted for various devices
- Option with chords and triads (which will be further developed as it doesn't work perfectly yet due to having too few sounds on the current keyboard)

## How to Use
1. Click the "Play random sound" button to play a randomly selected piano sound
2. Click on any piano key to lock/unlock it (locked keys will not be randomly selected)
3. Use the "Show sound name"/"Hide sound name" button to control the visibility of information about the currently played sound

## Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Web Audio API

## Local Installation and Launch
1. Clone the repository to your computer
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser

## Adding Your Own Sounds
To add your own piano sounds:
1. Place sound files in MP3 or WAV format in the `sounds/` folder
